# AURA (Full-Stack Student Assistant)

Think Jarvis, but for students who procrastinate better than they plan.  
AURA is your academic co-pilot, here to organize schedules, answer burning questions, and keep your chaos only slightly less chaotic.

Built with React (for snazzy looks), Express (for backend wizardry), and Firebase (so your tasks survive your memory lapses).  
AURA chats with you using OpenRouter AI—finally, answers without judgment.  
Drag, drop, quiz, flashcard, and get motivational quotes shorter than your attention span.  
Styled with styled-components, animated with framer-motion, and sprinkled with Spline 3D—because productivity should look cool.

AURA: For students who want to get things done, but also want their apps to look like sci-fi.  
Because Google Calendar never told you to “keep calm and finish that assignment.” But AURA just might.
